Documents can be found on the East Herts District Council Planning website, reference 3/17/1900/ful.Planning for a new home is virtually impossible in the wellpond Green area as it is an area of development constraint. Approval for this was only achieved after many years and by sacrificing a large workshop situated on the rear plot so this will be demolished as part of the building work. The site at the rear is available if the buyer requires both front and rear plots.The accommodation as approved includes features as below. These can be varied (subject to approval) to meet personal tastes.Galleried entrance hall with a roof lantern giving light, three reception rooms set off a central corridor, kitchen/dining room, utility, larder and boot room, On the first floor, there are five bedroom suites. Outside, there will be a detached garage block and mature gardens including a fine orchard. The site extends to about 1.1 acres. Full plans and drawings available on request.This is a lightly wooded area containing some of the most valuable houses in the area and a virtually perfect position for commuting. The A10 and M11 are both within 5 miles, there is a mainline station in Bishops Stortford about 6 miles away with regular services to London Liverpool Street, Cambridge and Stansted Airport. There are excellent private and state schools in the area.Agents Notes: Savings in stamp duty could be around £200,000 and as a new build it is zero rated for VAT also saving 20% on the build costs. Changing the layout of the rooms, main windows even the position within the plot could all be modified with a simple planning variation. For example the principle rooms with lovely views can be at the front, to the left and at ground level on rear and right hand sides. If desired, a smaller houe design would be possible (possibly requiring planning consent).The hamlet of Wellpond Green is a highly regarded area well known for its outstanding beauty and mix of exclusive homes. Local facilities area available at the nearby villages of Much Hadham and Standon which offer a butchers, bakers, a convenience store and public houses. The market towns of Bishop's Stortford and Hertford offer multiple shopping and sporting facilities, schooling for all ages and main line railway stations. Vehicular access is available nearby to the A10 and M11 both providing access to the M25 and London to the south with the A1 and Cambridge to the North. Stansted, London's third international airport, is approximately 8 miles away. In addition to excellent state schools in the area there is a choice of private schooling at Bishop's Stortford College, St Edmunds College, Heath Mount and Haileybury College.
