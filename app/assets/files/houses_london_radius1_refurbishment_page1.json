In recent years, the house has been modernised, with the addition of a copper-clad extension to the top floor, and an entire interior refurbishment by architectural designer, Leo Bachmann. Accommodation extends to 1,715 sq ft, overlooking an expansive back garden, a short distance from Wanstead Tube station.Now, the house embodies an honesty and integrity in materials synonymous with the doctrines of John Ruskin, William Morris and Augustus Pugin. It also exhibits refined instances of contemporary design, as seen in the master bedroom, which elegantly utilises the extended space to create an elevated sleeping quarters, with views over substantial gardens below and the treetops of Wansted Flats beyond.The front elevation of the house blends in seamlessly with its neighbours on Woodlands Avenue, a peaceful residential street. In terms of volume and configuration, this is as far the similarities extend. Beyond the entrance hall, Leo Bachmann has sought to create a series of spaces that flow seamlessly together, naturally emphasising the flow of natural light in his use of neutral tones and wood, from the rear of the house, right through to the original bay window at the front. A contemporary kitchen occupies this space in the house and has an island in arabescato marble, an original hearth and a built-in pine dresser. The dresser and cabinetry have been washed in Swedish floor soap, naturally dying the grain. Natural tones of Earthborn claypaint have been used throughout the house.Pine boards, treated with the same Swedish wash, run across the remainder of this floor, connecting the kitchen aesthetically to a dining area with original Edwardian fireplace and a hearth of quarry tiles. There is also a highly practical boot room and utility area with a butler sink and plenty of storage space. Beyond, is a newly-created living room, with a glazed roof and window seat with views out over garden. This area of the house has been insulated with Welsh wool.The garden is arguably one the house’s most attractive properties. It is south-facing, approximately fifty metres in length and has a paved patio space for outside dining. A mature bay tree is positioned to one side of this space, which produces wonderfully fragrant leaves for cooking. There is also a storage shed at the farthest end, as well as side access.The first floor is occupied by three bedrooms and a family bathroom with Graphenstone polished plaster. One of the bedrooms is currently arranged as a nursery and has a large bay window at the front of the house. Another is used as a study and has an original Edwardian tiled fireplace and re-claimed cast iron radiators, in addition to a beautifully curved wall. Original pine floorboards run across this level, which have also been organically washed.The second storey is occupied by the master bedroom suite. Exposed brickwork on the stairway leads up to a wonderfully bright space with a Juliet balcony at the rear offering wonderful views of the surrounding countryside, including the garden in the foreground, Wansted Flats in the distance and Epping Forest beyond. Panels of glazing in the ceiling also draw in light from above. The woodwork on this floor is Douglas Fir and extends to the en-suite bathroom which is partially open-plan, concealing a shower, bath and dressing area.The ethos of the Arts and Crafts movement is often viewed in opposition to the machine-friendly outlook of Modernism. However, both movements championed a truth and integrity in materials, while they may have deployed different design principles in service of their beliefs. This house embodies the best of both schools of thought, seeking to unify the old with the new in a tonally warm and earthy set of spaces which champion their materials, while emphasising space, light and the verdant surroundings, outside the walls of house.The house is excellently positioned for the shops, cafes and restaurants of Wanstead village. It is also within the catchment area of Alderbrook Primary school which was recently rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted.Green spaces abound.
