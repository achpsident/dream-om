This home has recently been extended and refurbished to provide a versatile and beautiful home for an established family. To the ground floor the cosy front room compliments the large kitchen/diner which stretches across the back of the property so for either a quiet night in or a family occasion it's easily accommodated.There is a ground floor bathroom which is handy if the children have been playing in the garden and it also alleviates the early morning rush out the door for work or school. To the first floor there are three bedrooms, (two of them are doubles), and a shower room. To the second floor the loft has been converted to provide two further bedrooms and a wet room. It was noticeable just how peaceful and quiet the house is. It also sits on a elevated position to the road with houses opposite so the views stretch far and wide across the local area and with the Juliet balcony to one of them, waking up and taking in the fresh morning air will never fail to put a smile on your face. There is a very large garden to the rear affording all the space you could need whether it's for the children to play, grow your own vegetables, have garden parties or just to relax and unwind in the warmer months.Agents note: The vendors have been granted permission for a single storey extension (6 x 6 meters). Further details can be obtained if required.What the Owner says:We moved from Snaresbrook to this location as we wanted access to the City alongside fantastic local amenities. Raylodge Primary school currently has an outstanding rating on Ofsted. Raylodge Park is a wonderful place to spend with family at the weekend. Very recently we converted the loft which provides a huge amount of versatility to our home. Apart from that we have laid new carpets, plastered, painted and decorated and all of this was done with a view of staying here long term so no expense was spared. This is a friendly street and we have lovely neighbours and can't express enough just how quiet it is here. It really is the best of both worlds as within a short walk you can reach an abundance of amenities and still return to a peaceful environment.Room sizes:Ground floorEntrance PorchEntrance HallLounge 12'8 x 12'5 (3.86m x 3.79m)Kitchen/Diner 18'9 x 10'5 (5.72m x 3.18m)StorageBathroomFirst floorLandingBedroom 1 12'6 x 11'0 (3.81m x 3.36m)Bedroom 2 10'7 x 8'0 (3.23m x 2.44m)Bedroom 5 7'7 x 6'4 (2.31m x 1.93m)Shower RoomSeperate WCSecond floorLandingBedroom 3 12'7 x 10'3 (3.84m x 3.13m)Juliet BalconyBedroom 4 15'0 x 7'3 (4.58m x 2.21m)Wet RoomOutsideFront GardenLarge Rear GardenOutside Storage ShedThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.
