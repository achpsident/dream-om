In recent years, the house has been modernised, with the addition of a copper-clad extension to the top floor, and an entire interior refurbishment by architectural designer, Leo Bachmann. Accommodation extends to 1,715 sq ft, overlooking an expansive back garden, a short distance from Wanstead Tube station.Now, the house embodies an honesty and integrity in materials synonymous with the doctrines of John Ruskin, William Morris and Augustus Pugin. It also exhibits refined instances of contemporary design, as seen in the master bedroom, which elegantly utilises the extended space to create an elevated sleeping quarters, with views over substantial gardens below and the treetops of Wansted Flats beyond.The front elevation of the house blends in seamlessly with its neighbours on Woodlands Avenue, a peaceful residential street. In terms of volume and configuration, this is as far the similarities extend. Beyond the entrance hall, Leo Bachmann has sought to create a series of spaces that flow seamlessly together, naturally emphasising the flow of natural light in his use of neutral tones and wood, from the rear of the house, right through to the original bay window at the front. A contemporary kitchen occupies this space in the house and has an island in arabescato marble, an original hearth and a built-in pine dresser. The dresser and cabinetry have been washed in Swedish floor soap, naturally dying the grain. Natural tones of Earthborn claypaint have been used throughout the house.Pine boards, treated with the same Swedish wash, run across the remainder of this floor, connecting the kitchen aesthetically to a dining area with original Edwardian fireplace and a hearth of quarry tiles. There is also a highly practical boot room and utility area with a butler sink and plenty of storage space. Beyond, is a newly-created living room, with a glazed roof and window seat with views out over garden. This area of the house has been insulated with Welsh wool.The garden is arguably one the house’s most attractive properties. It is south-facing, approximately fifty metres in length and has a paved patio space for outside dining. A mature bay tree is positioned to one side of this space, which produces wonderfully fragrant leaves for cooking. There is also a storage shed at the farthest end, as well as side access.The first floor is occupied by three bedrooms and a family bathroom with Graphenstone polished plaster. One of the bedrooms is currently arranged as a nursery and has a large bay window at the front of the house. Another is used as a study and has an original Edwardian tiled fireplace and re-claimed cast iron radiators, in addition to a beautifully curved wall. Original pine floorboards run across this level, which have also been organically washed.The second storey is occupied by the master bedroom suite. Exposed brickwork on the stairway leads up to a wonderfully bright space with a Juliet balcony at the rear offering wonderful views of the surrounding countryside, including the garden in the foreground, Wansted Flats in the distance and Epping Forest beyond. Panels of glazing in the ceiling also draw in light from above. The woodwork on this floor is Douglas Fir and extends to the en-suite bathroom which is partially open-plan, concealing a shower, bath and dressing area.The ethos of the Arts and Crafts movement is often viewed in opposition to the machine-friendly outlook of Modernism. However, both movements championed a truth and integrity in materials, while they may have deployed different design principles in service of their beliefs.

Formerly two farm workers’ cottages, the property was converted into one house some years ago. Over the years it has been a much loved family home but would now benefit from being updated. Rooms are generously proportioned and light, with good ceiling heights. The drawing room is particularly appealing as it has two lovely bay windows overlooking the front and side gardens, whilst at the other end of the room French windows open onto the rear lawn; making it ideal for entertaining. There is a good size kitchen withadjacent utility room, and another door leadingto the dining room. Stairs lead to the first floorwhere the dual aspect study overlooks the front garden, as does the master bedroom next door. This bedroom has useful fitted wardrobes and an en suite bathroom. A further bedroom and family bathroom complete the first floor accommodation. The second floor comprises two further bedrooms, one of which is particularly large and has a wash hand basin.Ladyfield House lies in an enviable location in the parish of Stratfield Mortimer, on the outer edge of the village of Mortimer Common. There is an excellent range of local facilities including supermarket, post office, schools, library, anddoctor's and dentist's surgeries. Mortimer station is only a few minutes’ walk away with trains to Reading and Basingstoke easily accessed, and subsequent links to London from within the hour. With the arrival of Crossrail into Reading in 2019, journey times and connectivity to Canary Wharf and the City will dramatically improve. Four services an hour during peak times are currently being publicised, and a journey time to Canary Wharf from Reading from 68 minutes. There is also excellent access to the M4 junction 11 and the M3 junction 5 with links to the national motorway network, central London, Heathrow and Gatwick Airports. There are several good schools in the area including Elstree School, Bradfield College, Downe House and Pangbourne College.Sitting in its plot of just under one and a half acres, Ladyfield House is in a unique situation.Lying in an elevated positon at the side of Foudry Brook, it overlooks its gardens and a very large fish pond edged by trees and bushes. To the other side of the house is the delightful Church of St Mary the Virgin. The house is approached via a 5 bar gate and a long private tarmac drive leads across the partially fenced paddock to a double garage from where a pretty footbridge gives access to the house.The large, historic Fish Pond to the east of the house is a unique and very special feature. It is thought to have been dug in past centuries tosupply fish to Stratfield Mortimer Manor (now gone) and is home to a large head of Carp (Common and Mirror) and is a wonderful havenfor wildlife. Due to its history and rarity it is registered as such with the Environment Agency.To the rear of the house a paved area leads onto he lawn and a brick and timber outbuilding, which houses separate workshop and storage areas. Past the outbuilding a further area can be found alongside the brook which has widened out at this stage, and is bordered by mature trees and open farmland.","post_town":"Reading","details_url":"https://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/48896704?utm_source=v1:_qPMCSTPGhnVqh6uZKo4vy_qJBQ40eGZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"A charming period family home in need of some modernisation, set in an idyllic yet very convenient location.

The surrounding countryside is designated an area of ‘Outstanding Natural Beauty’ and historically this was a natural crossing point of the river, set between the Berkshire Downs and Chiltern Hills, known geographically as the ‘Goring Gap’. The interesting High Street, which forms the central part of the village running down to the river and the bridge across to Goring, is now a ‘Conservation Area’ where there are a wealth of period properties many of considerable architectural merit including a thatched cottage, a beautiful William and Mary house and an Elizabethan Farmhouse, supposedly haunted by a lady in white. Following the building of the railway through the Thames Valley by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in approximately 1840, the villagers of Streatley decided the railway should go on the Goring side with the result now that while Streatley has changed little, the village of Goring on Thames has grown substantially and is now the larger village.In the village there is a parish church with Norman origins, a luxury riverside four star hotel, The Swan, which also offers a leisure and fitness club and at the top of the High Street is the Bull Inn which was an old coaching inn when the Royal Mail stopped en-route between Oxford and London. There is also a prestigious golf club, established over one hundred years ago, set amidst beautiful rolling countryside. The village also boast its own very well regarded Streatley Primary School, with the outstanding secondary school, ‘The Downs’, being in catchment for the village also, and having its own bus route. The local area is also extremely well catered for by private schools, with school busses also leaving from the end of Townsend Road for St Helen & St Catherine’s, and The Manor.Behind Streatley the ground rises steeply where the Berkshire Downlands meet the wide Thames Valley and from the top there are panoramic views far into Oxfordshire. The woodland and hills surrounding Streatley have been acquired in recent years by the National Trust and the extensive bridleways and footpaths are now open to the public.Across the river, the larger village of Goring on Thames offers a wide range of amenities and facilities including shops, modern health centre, traditional inns, a hotel, library, dentist and importantly a main line railway station providing excellent commuter services to Oxford, Reading and up to London (Paddington). There is also easy access for the major local towns, including Oxford, Reading and Newbury, the M40 and M4 motorways, the latter linking directly to Heathrow.In 2019 Crossrail services are scheduled to be commencing from Reading which together with the electrifying of the line will significantly improve travelling times to Paddington and central London destinations.Hill Gardens built by well-respected builder John Wakefield in the late 1980’s, is a select small development of impressive detached houses of differing architectural design and appearance, quietly located in an elevated setting close to the heart of the village and the historic High Street, and only a few minutes’ walk from the highly ‘Ofsted’ rated Primary School. The locally based Developer John Wakefield has gained an enviable reputation for building superior traditionally designed Homes of high quality in premier locations.Property description1 Hill Gardens enjoys an advantageous position overlooking private mature grounds that surround the property and a lightly wooded small copse opposite. Incorporating a traditional and most attractive architectural design, the property has appealing multi stock red brick elevations under a pitched clay tiled roof with a large covered porch overlooking the front gardens.The accommodation is light and bright benefiting from large windows and is well apportioned offering spacious family sized accommodation. Enlarged and modernised throughout, with kitchen and bathrooms newly installed, careful attention has been paid to enhance the original architectural features, whilst adding a more contemporary flair, with open plan modern accommodation blending seamlessly with that of a more traditional nature culminating in the presentation of a super family home.A wonderful opportunity afforded, early viewing is advised.Gardens & groundsThe property has a wide mature frontage to Hill Gardens with a delightful mainly lawned garden extending across the frontage with at one end, a two-car wide entrance drive leading to the original garaging, now forming a store to the front, and Games Room to the rear.There are pedestrian paths running across the front and down the sides of the house meeting tall wooden pedestrian gates giving access through to the rear garden, whilst also providing additional security.The main garden lies to the rear of the property and is neatly lawned with established trees and shrubs around the boundaries, providing additional privacy and an attractive backdrop. Extending across the rear of the house, approached through the patio doors from the dining room and the veranda, is a wide stone laid patio terrace, perfect for ‘Al Fresco’ dining. To the further end of the terrace, attractively sited under a timber logia, there is a Scandinavian style hot tub.Both private and delightfully attractive, the gardens and grounds extend to approximately 0.163 of an acre and must be viewed to be fully appreciated.General servicesServices: Mains electricity, water, and drainage are connected to the property.

Located in Fordcombe which is described as A Beautiful Village In The Garden of England which we equally feel is certainly an apt description. Not every village these days has a village pub however Fordcombe has a lovely period public house that fits in nicely with the area, it's called the Chafford Arms and also has a restaurant and garden with views over the local farm and fields. The property is a grade two listed black and white detached cottage (hence the name) and has 4 to 5 first floor bedrooms as well as 4 ground floor reception rooms (including the conservatory) and has extensive gardens to the front side and rear. The side section of the garden extends back to the top of the lane which gives you some idea of how large this plot is. This impressive home is located in the delightful village of Fordcombe which is just outside the historic Kent County of Royal Tunbridge Wells. This property is located in a private country lane and backs directly onto farmland. From just standing outside and looking up to the property you get a feel that this is something special. And once you are inside you will appreciate the space and character that is featured throughout which includes beams to various wall and ceilings as well as an impressive main reception room with a large inglenook fireplace and vaulted beamed ceiling. When we walked around this ourselves it is noticeable that there is a need for updating and modernisation to various parts of this home which has been reflected in the asking price. The kitchen has a large fitted pine dresser and also a large useful pantry as well as a further deep cupboard where the gas central heating boiler is located. The conservatory opens out to the rear garden and has views to the extensive side part of the garden. From the kitchen you can access the dining room and a further lounge with fireplace. This opens into the front hallway which in turn then has access to the principle reception room which has a staircase leading up to an atrium and the master bedroom suite that includes a dressing room and a bathroom. We could carry on with the list of features but we are sure you will want to see this for yourself when carry out your own viewing which we of course do recommend you book early as we do expect a lot of interest in this very exclusive property. Fordcombe as we have said is an attractive village yet is only around 4 miles from Tunbridge Wells and 3 miles from Penshurst. Eastbourne is around 35 miles away. Within this area are many places of interest to visit as well as the main historic Kent Town of Royal Tunbridge Wells with the impressive Pantiles area. Reeds Rains are joint sole selling agents with Bardens of Tunbridge Wells.Entrance HallCharacter original entrance door into a square entrance hall. Fireplace.

Located in Fordcombe which is described as A Beautiful Village In The Garden of England which we equally feel is certainly an apt description. Not every village these days has a village pub however Fordcombe has a lovely period public house that fits in nicely with the area, it's called the Chafford Arms and also has a restaurant and garden with views over the local farm and fields. The property is a grade two listed black and white detached cottage (hence the name) and has 4 to 5 first floor bedrooms as well as 4 ground floor reception rooms (including the conservatory) and has extensive gardens to the front side and rear. The side section of the garden extends back to the top of the lane which gives you some idea of how large this plot is. This impressive home is located in the delightful village of Fordcombe which is just outside the historic Kent County of Royal Tunbridge Wells. This property is located in a private country lane and backs directly onto farmland. From just standing outside and looking up to the property you get a feel that this is something special. And once you are inside you will appreciate the space and character that is featured throughout which includes beams to various wall and ceilings as well as an impressive main reception room with a large inglenook fireplace and vaulted beamed ceiling. When we walked around this ourselves it is noticeable that there is a need for updating and modernisation to various parts of this home which has been reflected in the asking price. The kitchen has a large fitted pine dresser and also a large useful pantry as well as a further deep cupboard where the gas central heating boiler is located. The conservatory opens out to the rear garden and has views to the extensive side part of the garden. From the kitchen you can access the dining room and a further lounge with fireplace. This opens into the front hallway which in turn then has access to the principle reception room which has a staircase leading up to an atrium and the master bedroom suite that includes a dressing room and a bathroom. We could carry on with the list of features but we are sure you will want to see this for yourself when carry out your own viewing which we of course do recommend you book early as we do expect a lot of interest in this very exclusive property. Fordcombe as we have said is an attractive village yet is only around 4 miles from Tunbridge Wells and 3 miles from Penshurst. Eastbourne is around 35 miles away. Within this area are many places of interest to visit as well as the main historic Kent Town of Royal Tunbridge Wells with the impressive Pantiles area.
