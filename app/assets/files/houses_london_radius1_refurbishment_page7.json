There is the possibility to obtain consents for both the repair/upgrading of this timber framed property and planning permission for development in the garden subject to strict guidelines by the English Heritage Society and Hillingdon Borough Council.Eldar Farm is a very unique medieval farmhouse and rarely comes to the market having been within the current vendor’s family for well over 150 years. In its original form the house would have been rendered white rather than the current pebbledash exterior, the walls are constructed from a technique called Wattle and Daub and boasts the original flagstone flooring. With an abundance of character the current layout of the Farm House comprises of an entrance lobby leading to a utility area and sitting room, inner hallway, kitchen, bathroom, dining room and a front living room all located on the ground floor level. To the first there are four double bedrooms and an inner lobby with the total floor space measuring nearly 1400 sq ft. Other benefits include approximately half an acre of gardens and an orchard with a number of mature fruit trees as well as ample off street parking.Located to the north of Heathrow Airport and within half a mile of the main Bath Road, the property sit’s at the far end of West End Lane which is a mainly residential road with a mixture of modern and older style houses as well as maisonettes. There are three main bus routes that service the property which are the 140, H98 and 90 providing access to Hounslow, Hayes and Northolt. Hayes and Harlington mainline station is less than 2 miles from the property and will greatly benefit from the Crossrail link in late 2018/19 which will link the area to East London by a 30 minute train journey. There are several schools in the local area as well as open parkland, convenience stores and public houses. The M4 is easily accessible and provides links to the M25 as well as a direct route into Central London.

It's a residential area, which is quite literally the gate of Epping Forest, starting with the rural grasslands of Wanstead Flats to the north. The multicultural buzz of Green Street runs up from Upton Park with its profusion of South Asian and, to a lesser extent, Afro-Caribbean food and goods. The area is also home to West Ham Park, which offers a more horticultural experience to the wildness of Wanstead Flats.\"Observation (*2):This is a unique property with a plethora of possibilities for investors subject to planning.

There are three bedrooms to the first floor including a very large 13'8 x 11'0 bedroom to the front with built-in wardrobes. The very attractive modern first floor bathroom is dressed with granite tiles, and contains separate shower and bath. The loft has been converted to provide a gorgeous master suite with very large bedroom, Juliette balcony to the rear, incredible views toward the river, City airport and Canary Wharf to the front, and a beautiful white marble ensuite bathroom.The current vendors have drastically improved the rear garden by undertaking the removal of a large section of earth at the back of the house. This has created a large terrace, ideal for summer outdoor dining/barbecue and children's play area. It has also helped to bring light into the kitchen and rear reception room. The garden then steps up to a large deck, lawn, flowerbeds and a large office shed with insulated roof, laminated flooring, fit-in desk and bookshelves, electricity, and phone and internet connections.The property is located in the heart of Shooters Hill. Being within the London Green Belt it enjoys fresh, clean air. The house is within short walking distance from Shooters Hill Golf Club and Oxleas Wood, one of the few remaining ancient forests. It is also only a few-minute drive from the Royal Observatory Greenwich.This is an impressive period home with a very stylish and modern feel that has become available due to unexpected relocation. Your immediate viewing is essential.
