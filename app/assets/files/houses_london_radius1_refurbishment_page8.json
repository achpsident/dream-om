The Royal Arsenal has already established a village community that is set to grow and improve beyond recognition. It was a former military barracks, parade ground and munitions storage and factory site dating from 1761 and is built on wide open spaces that have been beautifully landscaped on the banks of the Thames. It already has an established village community with significant commercial/social infrastructure that is set to grow and improve beyond recognition over the next few years once Crossrail is up and running.This is your chance to be part of the next London property hot spot at entry-level prices, allowing you to benefit from great value for money and exciting potential capital gains.Onsite AmenitiesThe Royal Arsenal is a beautiful, private riverside gated development with:24-House Concierge, Parcel Reception and Security.Onsite Parks and Riverwalks Boulangerie Jade - Bakery and Cafe Dry Cleaning ServicesMassage SalonYoung's Brewery Gastro Pubs - The Dial Arch and The GuardhouseFarmers' MarketCar Hire and Electric Vehicle Charging PointsTesco Express, Marks and Spencer's Food and Sainsbury's LocalCon Gusto Italian RestaurantMedical Centre with gp's Surgery and PharmacyPrivate DentistChildren's Nursery and DaycareChildren's Activity CentreThe Taproom Craft Brewery and Pub and Restaurant7R Gym and CrossfitRoyal Arsenal Boot CampsStephen James Car Showroom Travel and Shopping5 to 10 minutes' walk from Woolwich's high street, cafes and market.

London City Airport is only two stops away by DLR - its close enough for convenience but Royal Arsenal does not have any overhead flights.Future plans for the Royal Arsenal Huge investment is being made on the Royal Arsenal development, including onsite restaurants and wine bars, new retail space, a new hotel, Elizabeth Line Cross Rail Station opening 2018 and the newly announced Dash Arts Cultural Centre, a theatre and arts arena coming in 2019/2020.Regeneration of WoolwichA new Civic Centre on Wellington Street provides a new library, post office and cafe/bar. Behind the centre a brand-new Tesco superstore has recently opened alongside a town centre car park and 1000 new homes. The Tesco store is an eco-store powered by solar panels and wind turbines, and has a farmers' market selling local produce, and two children's playgrounds.At the western end of Powis Street, there is a designated development are known as the Woolwich Triangle - construction will soon commence for a new shopping centre with a major retailer taking centre stage. The Triangle development will include a leisure space, cafes and restaurants. The whole area covers an area of 300,000sqft and will revitalise the whole western end of the Town Centre as a car-free zone. Woolwich gets its own 'West End'. In fact British Land recently spent £100M acquiring land and buildings in Woolwich.The High Street will also benefit from the restoration of the existing Grade II listed buildings to give extra character and focus. The old Co-op building has now been refurbished with more buildings to be done. Once refurbished these historic buildings will accommodate new retail brands and major high street names, the whole area will become more vibrant during the day and in to the evening with new coffee bars and restaurants.£6.6million was recently spent on the redesign of General Gordon Square and Beresford Square near to the Woolwich Arsenal DLR and Train stations. This is now complete, and features include new landscape planting, seating areas, a large digital media display for sporting and public events and a new water feature.Please note: Care is taken in preparing the property details, dimensions and photos, however the accuracy of all the above is in no way guaranteed nor do these details form part of any contract.

There is a lovely rear patio garden which is a welcome haven from the stress of daily life and an enormous basement with over five feet head height - great for storage. Locally, there is plenty to shout about - you're within a minute's stroll of a Tesco Express for milk and a paper on a Sunday. The wonderful refurbished Burgess Park is three minutes on foot and Camberwell and Peckham are but a brief ramble. A minute's stroll will bring you to the bus stop that whisks you to Elephant and Castle in under 10 minutes!Enter off the street into a neat entrance hall with beautiful floorboards and crisp neutral decor. The first living space is light and lovely with built-in book shelves, fitted storage and a neat curving staircase. The repositioning of the stairwell has created a vast amount of extra living space and you can even position a dining table with plenty of space leftover. Glass pane doors open rear to a second reception with more tasty timber floors, wood-burner (compliant with stringent clean air laws), storage space and a view of the garden. The kitchen runs off from here with solid wood worktops, a large ceramic sink with mixer tap, contemporary cabinets and a lofty vaulted ceiling with two skylights. French doors run from here onto your cute garden - the perfect haven from the bustle of London.Ascending those sleek, solid and stylish curving stairs (with newly finished dark treads and beaming white risers) you reach a rectangular landing. The master bedroom fronts the street. There are fitted wardrobes hugging the chimney breast and more pale neutral wall shades. The second bedroom (also a great size) faces rear and is a bright space with more wooden floors. The bathroom sits in between with a clean white suite, heated towel rail and immaculate tiling.The daily commute is easy - grab the 343 bus (to London Bridge) on Wells Way or you can walk past the tennis courts and rose gardens of Burgess Park (which has undergone a £8 million reinvention) in under 10 minutes in order to access any number of buses to the West End and the City (jump off at Elephant & Castle for the Bakerloo and Northern lines). The 136 also goes to Elephant & Castle and connects to the overground line at Queen's Road Peckham and New Cross Gate in the other direction. It's also a 24hour bus!

Even closer is the Flying Dutchman which offers regular social endeavours. Camberwell offers all the bars, restaurants and entertainments you could desire. We love the Hermit's Cave, The Crooked Well and the Camberwell Arms for a yummy roast. The South London Gallery is a must see! The varied delights of Bellenden Road are also within easy grasp.
