At the rear of the house you'll find an extended open-plan kitchen and dining/sitting room which affords stunning light from the large windows and doors, enhanced by slick concrete floors with water fed underfloor heating. This area also features a beautifully fitted Schmidt kitchen with solid concrete bench and stainless steel work tops adjacent to the oven. What completes this lovely room is a fitted wood burner to warm up those cold winter nights.The first floor has two bedrooms, the largest of which features a custom built wardrobe area, and an expansive ensuite-family bathroom. The large 2nd bedroom at the rear also has an en-suite shower. The loft space has been converted to provide one more master en-suite room, of which encompasses the whole loft space with en-suite shower room. This is a truly amazing house which offers a young family a comfortable and practical living space over three levels.Positioned near to the vibrant Myddleton Road, awarded Great British High Street of the Year in 2016. Within close proximity of the outstanding Bowes Park Nursery and some excellent primary and secondary schools. Tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Wood Green, Bowes Park is a charming enclave with its independent shops, restaurants and amenities.Nearest transport links are Bowes Park Station (National Rail) and either Wood Green or Bounds Green Underground Stations. (Piccadilly Line)The Sellers Thoughts -We moved into Whittington Road with our three children in 2010 after emigrating from New Zealand. The house had been in probate for some time and was in need of extensive refurbishment to restore it to accommodate a family of five. We almost didn't buy it, we are so very happy we did.During our years in our home we have completed a loft extension complete with ensuite and storage, removed the unused chimney to create additional space, juggled rooms around (sometimes on more than one occasion!) and added an rear extension that opens up to the large exterior living/entertaining space, all of which has created a wonderful family home. The old bricks from the chimney were carefully salvaged and now form the exterior paving to the front and rear.The summer sun floods the rear garden until late in the afternoon and the hydrangeas are beautiful in full bloom. Year on year the robins return to nest and when they arrive you know summers not far off!We have enjoyed living in the Bowes Park area and have watched it grow and develop over the years. We have many lovely people around that we have had the greatest pleasure meeting, great family bars (the Step, the Prince, Bohem, Mum's Lounge, the Ranelagh), the Middleton Road market on the first Sunday of every month and have easy walking access to Alexandra Palace and Durnsford Park and the activities and events they provide. Travel into the city is easy and convenient.Without a doubt we will miss our home; all the special fondness that memories re-kindle from our time spent in it. We sincerely hope that the new owners have as much enjoyment and fun as we have had in this home with our family and friends.Please contact Winkworth Harringay office to arrange an appointment to view Your local independently owned property agency with a network of 61 London offices.Est 1835","post_town":"London","details_url":"https://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/51436476?utm_source=v1:_qPMCSTPGhnVqh6uZKo4vy_qJBQ40eGZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"This Victorian terrace has been transformed into a beautiful three/four bedroom family home over three levels with an approx. 98 ft.

They altered the layout on the ground floor by slightly reducing the size of the main sitting room, which in turn allowed them to create a lovely big open-plan kitchen, dining and living space that opens straight out onto the gar-den. New double glazing installed was also installed, new carpets and wood flooring laid, the bathroom has been refurbished you name it, they did it and it's now absolutely beautiful and immaculate throughout. It's totally ready for the new owners to simply move in and enjoy, but if you did want to put your own stamp on the place there's definitely the potential to do more.The garden is another lovely space and very family friendly, it's mainly laid to lawn and edged with a mature border that creates a really nice feeling of privacy, so it's incredibly quiet, when you are sitting in the garden all you can hear is the birds singing. The house is so close to everything and yet out in the garden you feel so far removed from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.What the Owner says:My sister has lived just down the road from here for quite some time and so I know the area well, and i'd always been really impressed by both the quality of the local schools and the sheer convenience of the location. So when we decided to look for a new family home eleven years ago I thought this would be the ideal place to base our search. Unfortunately nothing that we looked at quite offered what we were searching for but then one day, quite by chance I happened to be walking down the road and I noticed a For Sale board outside this house. There was something about it that really caught my imagination so I booked in a viewing straight away and I was so impressed that I put in an offer there and then.This house has been a very happy home for us but we have recently moved abroad and so have decided that it's time to sell. I already miss it and the fabulous location but it's nice to think that a new family will fill it and i'm sure enjoy living in it just as much as we have.Room sizes:Entrance HallSitting Room 16'9 x 13'0 (5.11m x 3.97m)Dining Area 19'5 x 9'7 (5.92m x 2.92m)Kitchen Area 21'3 x 10'0 (6.48m x 3.05m)Utility RoomShower RoomLandingBedroom 1 14'5 x 12'1 (4.40m x 3.69m)Bedroom 2 12'7 x 10'11 (3.84m x 3.33m)Bedroom 2 12'7 x 10'11 (3.84m x 3.33m)Bedroom 3 9'8 x 7'10 (2.95m x 2.39m)Bedroom 4 8'6 x 7'7 (2.59m x 2.31m)BathroomLandingBedroom 5 13'1 x 10'2 (3.99m x 3.10m)GarageOff Street ParkingFront GardenRear GardenThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.

Over a period of 6 months we renovated the house and extended to the side and rear, creating an additional bedroom, bathroom, reception room and utility room. Attention to detail has always been important to us. We replaced all of the electrics and the heating system and put in a Megaflow tank along with a new boiler. Both bathrooms have underfloor heating. The kitchen is a luxury high specification German brand with bespoke Corian work surfaces. We also had all the windows and doors replaced and added bi-folding doors to the kitchen and had a custom made front door. The garden was also a big project and we flattened the lawn area and put down artificial grass but left the original apple tree from the orchard before the house was built. We will be very sad to leave this house as it has many good memories and Oak Lodge Avenue is a lovely, community based road to live with so many great people\"","post_town":"Chigwell","details_url":"https://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/49449031?utm_source=v1:_qPMCSTPGhnVqh6uZKo4vy_qJBQ40eGZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"We are delighted to offer for sale this beautiful, spacious and rarely available four bedroom family home.
