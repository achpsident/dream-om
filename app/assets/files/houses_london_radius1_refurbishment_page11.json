To the first floor there are three bedrooms, (two of them are doubles), and a shower room. To the second floor the loft has been converted to provide two further bedrooms and a wet room. It was noticeable just how peaceful and quiet the house is. It also sits on a elevated position to the road with houses opposite so the views stretch far and wide across the local area and with the Juliet balcony to one of them, waking up and taking in the fresh morning air will never fail to put a smile on your face. There is a very large garden to the rear affording all the space you could need whether it's for the children to play, grow your own vegetables, have garden parties or just to relax and unwind in the warmer months.Agents note: The vendors have been granted permission for a single storey extension (6 x 6 meters). Further details can be obtained if required.What the Owner says:We moved from Snaresbrook to this location as we wanted access to the City alongside fantastic local amenities. Raylodge Primary school currently has an outstanding rating on Ofsted. Raylodge Park is a wonderful place to spend with family at the weekend. Very recently we converted the loft which provides a huge amount of versatility to our home. Apart from that we have laid new carpets, plastered, painted and decorated and all of this was done with a view of staying here long term so no expense was spared. This is a friendly street and we have lovely neighbours and can't express enough just how quiet it is here. It really is the best of both worlds as within a short walk you can reach an abundance of amenities and still return to a peaceful environment.Room sizes:Ground floorEntrance PorchEntrance HallLounge 12'8 x 12'5 (3.86m x 3.79m)Kitchen/Diner 18'9 x 10'5 (5.72m x 3.18m)StorageBathroomFirst floorLandingBedroom 1 12'6 x 11'0 (3.81m x 3.36m)Bedroom 2 10'7 x 8'0 (3.23m x 2.44m)Bedroom 5 7'7 x 6'4 (2.31m x 1.93m)Shower RoomSeperate WCSecond floorLandingBedroom 3 12'7 x 10'3 (3.84m x 3.13m)Juliet BalconyBedroom 4 15'0 x 7'3 (4.58m x 2.21m)Wet RoomOutsideFront GardenLarge Rear GardenOutside Storage ShedThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.

Refurbished throughout by the current owners, who bought the house as a project three years ago. Each and every room has been meticulously re-styled and there has been the addition of a fabulous loft extension. They even have planning permission for a rear extension (B2017/76429), which would be the cherry on top of this superb home.Downstairs, there is plenty of living space with a stylishly cosy lounge and separate spacious dining room. There's more than enough space for a large dining table, so having the whole family over will never be an issue. There are also patio doors leading out to the garden, ideal for barbecue season! Upstairs there is space, space and more space! Perfect for families as all of the bedrooms are good sizes, so there will be no quarrelling over who gets which room. Both bathrooms are sleek & modern, the perfect place for a wake up boost to start your day, or a relaxing bubble bath to unwind of an evening. The driveway has been re-done in recent months and there's plenty of space for guests to park too.

Brand new bricks at the front, followed by new sash windows, you can tell this house is going to be a hit inside.

The bi-fold doors open onto the courtyard garden, making the latter feel like a natural extension of the kitchen, and perfect when entertaining over the summer.

Through the Home for Life Plan, anyone aged over sixty can purchase a lifetime lease on this property which discounts the price from its full market value. The size of the discount you are entitled to depends on your age, personal circumstances and property criteria and could be anywhere between 8.5% and 59% from the property´s full market value. The above price is for guidance only. It is based on our average discount and would be the estimated price payable by a 69-year-old single male. As such, the price you would pay could be higher or lower than this figure.For more information or a personalised quote, just give us a call. Alternatively, if you are under 60 or would like to purchase this property without a Home for Life Plan at its full market price of £820,000, please contact Douglas Allen.Property descriptionThis charming house is situated on Hale End road which means the walk to Highams Park overground station can be swift and stress free. In the local area there is an abundance of restaurants and bars alongside retails outlets for your day to day convenience. There are three supermarkets within one mile, Tesco, Sainsburys and a Morison. Epping Forest and Highams Park are also within walking distance so bike rides, jogging and seasonal walks can be taken amidst all the different colours that mother nature has to offer. Schools in this area are highly regarded to and the road links offer excellent access to local towns, Westfield in Stratford and also Stansted Airport for international travel. This home presents a family with lots of versatility. The large kitchen/diner to the rear certainly seems as the heart of the home where many a family meal can be cooked and enjoyed, whilst the lounge which stretches from front to back provides all the space you could need for family gatherings or special occasions. The extra room to the ground floor is adjacent to the shower room, so this would really suit an elderly relative or would make a perfect office if you work from home. There are three bedrooms and a family bathroom to the first floor. Throughout this home it feels modern, spacious and bright. Beyond that as soon as you walk through the door there is a fantastic feeling of home. With off road parking to the front means it's easy to get in with your weekly shopping, and there is a pretty and private rear garden with a covered patio providing a perfect space for summer parties and barbecues.What the Owner says:For the past seven years we have really enjoyed this location. There is so much to do in the local area and some beautiful places to explore. There is a dental surgery close by and the doctors surgery is just 0.3 miles away.Since we have been here we have added a new roof, redecorated throughout, replaced the boiler and radiators and also refurbished the bathroom and shower room. The ground floor bedroom and shower room are perfect when we have people to visit and stay, but this also gives options for other uses. We have now decided to move to a different location but this has been a friendly neighbourhood and a happy seven years for us.Room sizes:Ground floorEntrance HallLounge 18'7 x 12'4 (5.67m x 3.76m)Kitchen/Diner 21'8 x 17'9 (6.61m x 5.41m)Shower RoomBedroom 3 13'3 x 8'10 (4.04m x 2.69m)First floorLandingBedroom 1 12'4 x 12'1 (3.76m x 3.69m)Bedroom 2 11'10 x 8'8 (3.61m x 2.64m)Bedroom 4 9'10 x 9'5 (3.00m x 2.87m)BathroomOutsideOff Road Parking To frontRear GardenThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.

Not only is it just a short walk away from Bexleyheath's thriving Broadway, highly regarded schools and multiple bus routes, but it is also within a 20-minute walk to Barnehurst's mainline train station offering fast and frequent services into London.Internally, the home has been thoughtfully remodelled and refurbished to a very high standard that is evident in every room in the house. Open plan is all the rage these days and that is a trend that is definitely on point here as are modern grey colours with bold feature walls...It just works perfectly. The high gloss wall and base units in the kitchen are contrasted by a stunning granite worktop with breakfast bar area and there is plenty of room for all the appliances and American style Fridge/Freezer. The current layout sees the sunny conservatory as the dining area which is accessed via large bi-fold doors from the reception room.A growing family certainly needs an extra bathroom to cope with the morning rush to school and work. The contemporary first-floor bathroom is a fantastic size complete with a full-size step in shower cubicle and free standing bath that is complemented by the spacious ground floor shower room.Outside offers a Westerly facing garden with a patio that progresses to a large lawn area measuring approximately 60ft. The driveway to the front offers private parking for up to 3 vehicles.We have been advised that planning permission has been granted for a single storey extension to the rear of the home dated 16th August 2018 under reference number:18/01896/ful further details are available upon request.Call us today to book your earliest viewing appointment.This home includes:PorchEntrance HallReception3.68m x 3m (11 sqm) - 12' x 9' 10\" (118 sqft)Kitchen / Dining Room7.44m x 4.95m (36.8 sqm) - 24' 4\" x 16' 2\" (396 sqft)Conservatory2.74m x 2.2m (6 sqm) - 8' 11\" x 7' 2\" (64 sqft)Shower Room2.31m x 1.8m (4.1 sqm) - 7' 6\" x 5' 10\" (44 sqft)LandingMaster Bedroom3.67m x 3.65m (13.3 sqm) - 12' x 11' 11\" (144 sqft)Bedroom (Double)3.91m x 2.95m (11.5 sqm) - 12' 9\" x 9' 8\" (124 sqft)Bedroom (Double)4.01m x 2.87m (11.5 sqm) - 13' 1\" x 9' 4\" (123 sqft)Bedroom (Single)4.7m x 1.6m (7.5 sqm) - 15' 5\" x 5' 2\" (80 sqft)Bathroom2.5m x 2.29m (5.7 sqm) - 8' 2\" x 7' 6\" (61 sqft)Please note, all dimensions are approximate / maximums and should not be relied upon for the purposes of floor coverings.Additional Information:Council Tax: Band DEnergy Performance Certificate (EPC) Rating:Band F (21-38)Marketed by EweMove Sales & Lettings (Bexleyheath) - Property Reference 23229","post_town":"Bexleyheath","details_url":"https://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/51384721?utm_source=v1:_qPMCSTPGhnVqh6uZKo4vy_qJBQ40eGZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"We bet that you won't find better than this 4 bedroom family home that is ideally located in a quiet cul-de-sac in Martens Close, Bexleyheath.
