This lovely mews house has two off street parking spaces.The London Broker is proud to bring to market this excellent two-bedroom, freehold mews house set in the heart of sought-after Streatham Park Conservation area, close to the green expanses of Tooting Bec Common and Streatham Common. This modern, two-storied property was originally built in the early 1900s and is one of a limited number of freehold properties in the mews. The property is accessed through a private road, which is located close by to Streatham High Road. The house was completely refurbished in 2015 and is beautifully decorated throughout, offering spacious living in over 1,000sq ft. Of thoughtfully designed space.Standing in the entrance hall, you are presented with a wash-and-utility room directly ahead. To the left, the mews house opens out to give you a very light and airy open plan living / reception room, leading to a kitchen with all modern appliances, including integrated dishwasher and integrated double fridge/freezer. This open plan room is ideal for modern living, allowing space to relax at one end, and to entertain with a dining table at the other. The property also includes water softening capability.Upstairs, this delightful mews house offers you two bedrooms, both with en suite bathrooms. The bedrooms are ideally situated on either side of the staircase to maximise privacy, which, together with their private bathrooms, make the property perfect for both sharers and families alike. Both of these bedrooms also benefit from built in storage and under-floor heating in the bathrooms. This delightful mews house also comes with one off street car parking space.Thanks in large part to a visionary masterplan for the neighbourhood launched by Streatham Council in 2009, Streatham has secured itself as a sought-after area for young professionals and families alike, with this trend accelerating yearly. The Masterplan is a blueprint for the regeneration of the area, with a particular focus on increasing public space, restoring the Victorian glamour of the high street buildings and stores and improving the overall shopping and community experience in the neighbourhood. Ten years on, the fruits of the masterplan are becoming patently clear: The high street is now home to a diverse array of high-quality shops, restaurants and gastropubs, with a much more pedestrian-friendly feel than in years past. Annual food and music festivals also take place in the various green spaces around the high street, and so the neighbourhood has its fair share of hipsters and foodies along with the families and young professionals moving in. Local amenities have also greatly improved in recent years, including the opening of a full-service 24hr Tesco, as well as Marks & Spencer's and Sainsbury stores. For ice skating fans, the Streatham Ice and Leisure Centre is just around the corner, home to the Streatham RedHawks, one of the oldest ice hockey clubs in the UK. The Streatham Masterplan will ensure that Streatham will remain a desirable and community-focused neighbourhood for years to come.Away from the high street, the vast green spaces in the area are among the most popular in South London, offering locals a great place to walk their dogs, exercise, play, escape and enjoy. The Council recently invested over £1million into a new playground on the common to create a lovely place for children to play. At top of the Common is a Rookery with impeccably maintained historic gardens. The Rookery Café sits next door offering a full menu of cold / hot foods and drinks. Across the way is a paddling pool – perfect for the summer months.The property is located to several highly-rated primary and secondary schools, including Henry Cavendish, Dunraven, Immanuel and St Andrew CofE, St Andrew's Catholic, Woodmansterne, St Joseph's College, Norbury Manor, Graveney and Bishop Thomas Grant Catholic. The district is therefore excellent for families.Given its location, the property is extremely well connected with two main overland stations within walking distance. Streatham Station offers trains to London Bridge (25 min) and through to Blackfriars and Farringdon. Meanwhile, Streatham Common Station has train links to London Victoria (20 min), London Bridge (34 min) and trains through Shepherds Bush (for access to West London and Westfield Shopping Centre). In addition, a newly built bus terminal next to Tesco and a bus stop by St Leonard's Church gives you access to a network of bus routes across London. Dulwich, Peckham and Croydon are all easily reachable, and the M25 is accessible in 40 minutes. In addition, Gatwick airport is easily accessible by train or car.This charming property is ideally located to take advantage of all of these local amenities and will be a very happy home to a wide range of buyers, so be sure to book early!","post_town":"London","details_url":"https://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/51299773?utm_source=v1:_qPMCSTPGhnVqh6uZKo4vy_qJBQ40eGZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"An exceptional two bedroom freehold mews house with over 1000 sq ft of living space, located within close proximity to Tooting Bec Common.
