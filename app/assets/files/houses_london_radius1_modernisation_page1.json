Head up white painted steps to the front door. The entrance hall is bright and inviting and really has the wow-factor with those stunning Venetian plastered walls - they're so touchable! The original timber floors have been sanded and varnished and there is a rather grand staircase directly ahead. A step to the right reveals the first reception which boasts a magnificent sash bay with period shutters, superb (working) fireplace and marble mantel. A further reception comes next with another impressive fireplace and some calming rear leafy views. Currently used as a study the space could easily be used as a fourth bedroom. Back through the hall you'll find a handy guest wc with eco-loo. At the end of the hall you find an impressive family bathroom with fabulous walk-in shower, loo, heated towel rail and pretty roll top bath. Underfloor heating keeps the toes snug. Crisp white wooden panelling and royal blue walls finish it all off perfectly.Moving to the lower ground floor you'll meet a wonderful double reception that stretches the full length of the main footprint.

To the front there is a fireplace with a tasty art nouveau style mantel while the rear of the room has a striking original cast iron Victorian range with exposed brick feature wall. The hallway offers a further front access point with fitted security gate and recessed storage area — perfect for bikes and bins! Your kitchen is a real joy with chunky, solid oak worktops and five ring gas hob. The boiler was only fitted last year meaning you don't have to!

The accommodation comprises two/three superb reception rooms, three/four double bedrooms, a bright, modern kitchen, bountiful bathroom and a guest wc. The property backs onto the very lovely Brunswick Park which enjoys a new play area. The new cafe is perfect for a weekend natter while the kids run amok. Camberwell boasts a healthy array of culinary attractions - best watch those waist lines! Transport is a cinch with nearby Denmark Hill and Oval and Elephant and Castle Tube a short bus ride.</p><p class=\"top\">The raised ground floor entrance welcomes us through a walled front garden. Head up white painted steps to the front door. The entrance hall is bright and inviting and really has the wow-factor with those stunning Venetian plastered walls - they're so touchable! The original timber floors have been sanded and varnished and there is a rather grand staircase directly ahead. A step to the right reveals the first reception which boasts a magnificent sash bay with period shutters, superb (working) fireplace and marble mantel. A further reception comes next with another impressive fireplace and some calming rear leafy views. Currently used as a study the space could easily be used as a fourth bedroom. Back through the hall you'll find a handy guest wc with eco-loo. At the end of the hall you find an impressive family bathroom with fabulous walk-in shower, loo, heated towel rail and pretty roll top bath. Underfloor heating keeps the toes snug. Crisp white wooden panelling and royal blue walls finish it all off perfectly.  Moving to the lower ground floor you'll meet a wonderful double reception that stretches the full length of the main footprint. There's a front aspect bay of sash windows and rear French doors. To the front there is a fireplace with a tasty art nouveau style mantel while the rear of the room has a striking original cast iron Victorian range with exposed brick feature wall. The hallway offers a further front access point with fitted security gate and recessed storage area — perfect for bikes and bins! Your kitchen is a real joy with chunky, solid oak worktops and five ring gas hob. The boiler was only fitted last year meaning you don't have to!

In recent years, the house has been modernised, with the addition of a copper-clad extension to the top floor, and an entire interior refurbishment by architectural designer, Leo Bachmann. Accommodation extends to 1,715 sq ft, overlooking an expansive back garden, a short distance from Wanstead Tube station.Now, the house embodies an honesty and integrity in materials synonymous with the doctrines of John Ruskin, William Morris and Augustus Pugin. It also exhibits refined instances of contemporary design, as seen in the master bedroom, which elegantly utilises the extended space to create an elevated sleeping quarters, with views over substantial gardens below and the treetops of Wansted Flats beyond.The front elevation of the house blends in seamlessly with its neighbours on Woodlands Avenue, a peaceful residential street. In terms of volume and configuration, this is as far the similarities extend. Beyond the entrance hall, Leo Bachmann has sought to create a series of spaces that flow seamlessly together, naturally emphasising the flow of natural light in his use of neutral tones and wood, from the rear of the house, right through to the original bay window at the front. A contemporary kitchen occupies this space in the house and has an island in arabescato marble, an original hearth and a built-in pine dresser. The dresser and cabinetry have been washed in Swedish floor soap, naturally dying the grain. Natural tones of Earthborn claypaint have been used throughout the house.Pine boards, treated with the same Swedish wash, run across the remainder of this floor, connecting the kitchen aesthetically to a dining area with original Edwardian fireplace and a hearth of quarry tiles. There is also a highly practical boot room and utility area with a butler sink and plenty of storage space. Beyond, is a newly-created living room, with a glazed roof and window seat with views out over garden. This area of the house has been insulated with Welsh wool.The garden is arguably one the house’s most attractive properties. It is south-facing, approximately fifty metres in length and has a paved patio space for outside dining. A mature bay tree is positioned to one side of this space, which produces wonderfully fragrant leaves for cooking. There is also a storage shed at the farthest end, as well as side access.The first floor is occupied by three bedrooms and a family bathroom with Graphenstone polished plaster. One of the bedrooms is currently arranged as a nursery and has a large bay window at the front of the house. Another is used as a study and has an original Edwardian tiled fireplace and re-claimed cast iron radiators, in addition to a beautifully curved wall. Original pine floorboards run across this level, which have also been organically washed.The second storey is occupied by the master bedroom suite. Exposed brickwork on the stairway leads up to a wonderfully bright space with a Juliet balcony at the rear offering wonderful views of the surrounding countryside, including the garden in the foreground, Wansted Flats in the distance and Epping Forest beyond. Panels of glazing in the ceiling also draw in light from above. The woodwork on this floor is Douglas Fir and extends to the en-suite bathroom which is partially open-plan, concealing a shower, bath and dressing area.The ethos of the Arts and Crafts movement is often viewed in opposition to the machine-friendly outlook of Modernism. However, both movements championed a truth and integrity in materials, while they may have deployed different design principles in service of their beliefs.

Over a period of 6 months we renovated the house and extended to the side and rear, creating an additional bedroom, bathroom, reception room and utility room. Attention to detail has always been important to us. We replaced all of the electrics and the heating system and put in a Megaflow tank along with a new boiler. Both bathrooms have underfloor heating. The kitchen is a luxury high specification German brand with bespoke Corian work surfaces. We also had all the windows and doors replaced and added bi-folding doors to the kitchen and had a custom made front door. The garden was also a big project and we flattened the lawn area and put down artificial grass but left the original apple tree from the orchard before the house was built. We will be very sad to leave this house as it has many good memories and Oak Lodge Avenue is a lovely, community based road to live with so many great people\"","post_town":"Chigwell","details_url":"https://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/49449031?utm_source=v1:_qPMCSTPGhnVqh6uZKo4vy_qJBQ40eGZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"We are delighted to offer for sale this beautiful, spacious and rarely available four bedroom family home.

With 2 en-suites, a family bathroom, good bedroom sizes, and an abundance of storage, built in wardrobes and downstairs living accommodation to match, the home is perfectly suited to the needs of a large family with teenagers. Over the last few years several updates have been made to give the home a more contemporary feel and to make better use of the living space. Both of the en-suites have been renewed. The kitchen and dining area have been opened up and a new high specification kitchen area fitted to make this the new heart of the home. It is a fantastic entertaining area with enough space for a huge dining room table to gather the family together.
