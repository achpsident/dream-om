Externally there is a large front garden with a wooden framed cart house for parking of 3 cars and a shingle driveway with parking space for an additional 3 family cars. The front garden is bordered by hedgerow and a number of mature trees, shrubs and plants. The side garden is currently used by the current owners as an area for growing fruit and vegetables and lends itself well to this use. The rear garden is screened from the farm land beyond by mature evergreen trees and hedgerow. There is a large workshop/summer house offering the opportunity for a variety of uses, possibly a great spot for a summer house, with bar and pizza oven an outside office or a home gym. There is a pergola with feature pond in the centre and large greenhouse (that would benefit from upgrading). The rest of the space is given over to well tended lawn with the rear of the house enclosed by decking and overhead trellis. This garden is an incredible space, perfect for family time on a sunny afternoon or hosting friends for a bbq.Internally everything about this property is impressive in terms of its size and finish.The front door opens into a wide, bright and welcoming Entrance Lobby. The kitchen to the right has many bright white cupboards ensuring all the space you will ever need for kitchen storage, Dark floor and worktops offset the white cupboards and the built in ovens and separate gas hob add both style and practicality to the space. To the rear of the kitchen an arch leads into a sitting/breakfast area. With doors opening out onto the rear garden this is a great area for enjoying a coffee and some cake or reading a book whilst watching the birds in the garden beyond. To the left is a more formal dining room, with two windows providing views out over the rear garden.There are three further living spaces in the main house on the ground floor. At the end of the entrance hall the space opens up to create a lovely vestibule and provides the perfect area for a study or music/reading room. The living room and conservatory extend from the end of the property to the south east. The spacious living room is over 18ft by 14ft with a fireplace on the southern wall providing a lovely feature as well as winter warmth.A glazed door provides direct access onto the patio. This is a wonderful social space where families and friends can come together and make memories. Through the rear of the lounge a single door leads into a large and bright conservatory. A real sun trap, this large room is great as an additional living space to enjoy throughout the year or as somewhere to grow a wide variety of botanical delights.The ground floor also contains 2 of the main house's 5 bedrooms. There is a large double room with two built in wardrobes and a great en suite. The second room is a uniquely shaped single that makes a perfect kids room with room to sleep, room to play and room to hide from Mum and Dad! The ground floor is completed by a good size family cloakroom and a galley style utility room with countertop workspace, storage and room for washing machine, tumble dryer and additional fridge freezer if required.Upstairs the roof space has been brilliantly converted to house three further bedrooms and two bathrooms. There are two very light spacious doubles at either end of the long hallway. The double to the right hand side has 2 large built in wardrobes to maximise storage space and a good size modern en suite with full size bath, thus making this room the perfect Master Suite. There is a further bedroom along with another large family bathroom with separate bath and walk in shower.There is a more recent addition of a spacious self contained 1 bedroom annexe on the eastern end of the property which can be accessed from the main house. The annexe enjoys its own entrance hall with large storage cupboards and cloakroom. The L shaped living/dining room is designed to ensure you have all the space needed for sofas, tv's, sideboards and dining tables. The galley style kitchen, with its own door to the garden, is large enough for a 3 bedroom family home and its new cupboards and appliances provide a classic look. There is a large double bedroom with built in wardrobe, separate airing cupboard and bathroom with walk in shower. This is a fantastic additional space that offers many options for multi generational living within one property. A great space for an older couple; it would also suit younger adults looking for independent living.Due to its size and location next to similar developments this plot offers the opportunity of redevelopment subject to planning to hold 3 family homes with a total sale price of between £2.2m and £2.4m.This home includes:Kitchen3.9m x 3.62m (14.1 sqm) - 12' 9\" x 11' 10\" (151 sqft)Kitchen / Breakfast Room3.22m x 2.7m (8.6 sqm) - 10' 6\" x 8' 10\" (93 sqft)Dining Room3.49m x 3.22m (11.2 sqm) - 11' 5\" x 10' 6\" (120 sqft)Study3.82m x 2.83m (10.8 sqm) - 12' 6\" x 9' 3\" (116 sqft)Living Room5.62m x 4.28m (24 sqm) - 18' 5\" x 14' (258 sqft)Conservatory4.69m x 4.28m (20 sqm) - 15' 4\" x 14' (216 sqft)Utility Room2.95m x 1.97m (5.8 sqm) - 9' 8\" x 6' 5\" (62 sqft)Bedroom5.15m x 2.95m (15.1 sqm) - 16' 10\" x 9' 8\" (163 sqft)Bedroom4.63m x 4.29m (19.8 sqm) - 15' 2\" x 14' (213 sqft)Bedroom5.12m x 4.07m (20.8 sqm) - 16' 9\" x 13' 4\" (224 sqft)Bedroom4.63m x 4.07m (18.8 sqm) - 15' 2\" x 13' 4\" (202 sqft)Bedroom3.21m x 2.6m (8.3 sqm) - 10' 6\" x 8' 6\" (89 sqft)Bathroom3.5m x 2.6m (9.1 sqm) - 11' 5\" x 8' 6\" (97 sqft)Living/Dining Room6.79m x 2.92m (19.8 sqm) - 22' 3\" x 9' 6\" (213 sqft)AnnexeKitchen4.2m x 2.65m (11.1 sqm) - 13' 9\" x 8' 8\" (119 sqft)AnnexeBedroom4.13m x 2.85m (11.7 sqm) - 13' 6\" x 9' 4\" (127 sqft)AnnexeEnsuite2.97m x 1.56m (4.6 sqm) - 9' 8\" x 5' 1\" (49 sqft)AnnexeEntrance Hall2.29m x 1.87m (4.2 sqm) - 7' 6\" x 6' 1\" (46 sqft)AnnexeWC0.97m x 2.11m (2 sqm) - 3' 2\" x 6' 11\" (22 sqft)AnnexePlease note, all dimensions are approximate / maximums and should not be relied upon for the purposes of floor coverings.Additional Information:Detached BungalowSeparate 1 Bedroom Annexe6 Bedrooms, 6 BathroomsPlot of Over 0.5 AcreMature GardensCouncil Tax: Band FEnergy Performance Certificate (EPC) Rating:Band D (55-68)A unique and wonderful property set on a large plot in a highly desirable area.
