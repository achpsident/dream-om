You have bundles of living space, four bedrooms, two well-equipped bathrooms, huge cellar and patio garden with rear access. From here you can sample all the delights of this vibrant area. Clapham and Abbeville Village are each a comfortable stroll as is buzzing Brixton. Transport links are numerous and close by and you've Clapham Common and Brockwell Park in which to chill out.Once the property has entered the first reception on the left features a curved bay window and period fireplace. Next you meet a second reception with rear facing double doors providing garden access and another beautiful fireplace. Walls are a friendly shade of lavender and brilliant white, showing off ceilings and covings throughout. There are wooden floors underfoot waiting to be refurbished and brought to life. Head toward the rear to find a rather sizeable cellar on the lower floor, family bathroom and an enormous kitchen/diner. In here, worktops lay in an l-shaped position along the back and one side of the room so you have plenty of space for a dining table too. You can access the paved garden, which in turn leads to the outbuilding (access via Hetherington Road). On the split level is the first bedroom with windows to the rear and another period fireplace and a wc next door. The first floor as a master bedroom spanning the width of the house and a third bedroom also double in size with fitted wardrobes in the alcoves. A second 2-piece suite bathroom is on the third floor next to the fourth double bedroom. This property requires maintenance to the rear garden access area and boundary wall otherwise offered in the right condition for a personal touch to be added.You just can't lose with this location. It leaves you within a stones throw of Clapham, Abbeville Village and Brixton.The 137 is just around the corner and will whisk you to Sloane Square and Knightsbridge. Clapham North tube is about 5 minute walk for the Northern Line or you've got the Victoria Line in Brixton. Clapham and the ever popular Abbeville Village are but a 10 minute stroll from your front door. Clapham High Street will keep you busy whatever the weather - it'll take you the first three years to sample all their cuisine, and you can walk it off on Clapham Common. In the other direction, Brixton's all a buzz with the newly developed Windrush Square offering a marvellous place to sit, chat and drink coffee.

You have bundles of living space, four bedrooms, two well-equipped bathrooms, huge cellar and patio garden with rear access. From here you can sample all the delights of this vibrant area. Clapham and Abbeville Village are each a comfortable stroll as is buzzing Brixton. Transport links are numerous and close by and you've Clapham Common and Brockwell Park in which to chill out.Once the property has entered the first reception on the left features a curved bay window and period fireplace. Next you meet a second reception with rear facing double doors providing garden access and another beautiful fireplace. Walls are a friendly shade of lavender and brilliant white, showing off ceilings and covings throughout. There are wooden floors underfoot waiting to be refurbished and brought to life. Head toward the rear to find a rather sizeable cellar on the lower floor, family bathroom and an enormous kitchen/diner. In here, worktops lay in an l-shaped position along the back and one side of the room so you have plenty of space for a dining table too. You can access the paved garden, which in turn leads to the outbuilding (access via Hetherington Road). On the split level is the first bedroom with windows to the rear and another period fireplace and a wc next door. The first floor as a master bedroom spanning the width of the house and a third bedroom also double in size with fitted wardrobes in the alcoves. A second 2-piece suite bathroom is on the third floor next to the fourth double bedroom. This property requires maintenance to the rear garden access area and boundary wall otherwise offered in the right condition for a personal touch to be added.You just can't lose with this location. It leaves you within a stones throw of Clapham, Abbeville Village and Brixton.The 137 is just around the corner and will whisk you to Sloane Square and Knightsbridge. Clapham North tube is about 5 minute walk for the Northern Line or you've got the Victoria Line in Brixton. Clapham and the ever popular Abbeville Village are but a 10 minute stroll from your front door. Clapham High Street will keep you busy whatever the weather - it'll take you the first three years to sample all their cuisine, and you can walk it off on Clapham Common. In the other direction, Brixton's all a buzz with the newly developed Windrush Square offering a marvellous place to sit, chat and drink coffee. This is before we mention the ocean of funky bars, cafes and restaurants on offer - for some noodles and vino. The Ritzy cinema will keep any audience happy with its thoughtful mix of art house and mainstream titles and 'The White Horse' really rocks out on the weekend.For further information or to arrange a viewing, please contact our Brixton Branch on","post_town":"London","details_url":"https://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/46137391?utm_source=v1:_qPMCSTPGhnVqh6uZKo4vy_qJBQ40eGZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"Foster and Edwards offer this period four bedroom terrace house with bundles of space.","outcode":"SW2","image_645_430_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/645/430/a36d7cf47eaf27dff280884063cd170d59ba0243.jpg","county":"London","price":"850000","listing_id":"46137391","image_caption":"","image_80_60_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/80/60/a36d7cf47eaf27dff280884063cd170d59ba0243.jpg","status":"for_sale","agent_name":"Foster & Edwards","num_recepts":"2","country":"England","first_published_date":"2018-01-05 13:34:04","displayable_address":"Ashmere Grove, London SW2","price_modifier":"offers_in_region_of","floor_plan":["https://lc.zoocdn.com/693e0dc976cb7cdc9678fe96bfffa34ac9b7dbb8.jpg"],"street_name":"Ashmere Grove","num_bathrooms":"2","agent_logo":"https://st.zoocdn.com/zoopla_static_agent_logo_(114113).png","price_change":[{"direction":"","date":"2018-01-05 13:33:07","percent":"0%","price":"975000"},{"direction":"down","date":"2018-03-22 14:43:05","percent":"-7.6%","price":"900000"},{"direction":"down","date":"2019-04-02 11:27:07","percent":"-5.5%","price":"850000"}],"agent_phone":"020 3641 4807","image_354_255_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/354/255/a36d7cf47eaf27dff280884063cd170d59ba0243.jpg","image_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/354/255/a36d7cf47eaf27dff280884063cd170d59ba0243.jpg","last_published_date":"2019-04-02 11:28:10","price_change_summary":{"direction":"down","percent":"-12.8%","last_updated_date":"2019-04-02 11:27:07"}},{"country_code":"gb","num_floors":"0","image_150_113_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/150/113/59092613300e2338d951df4117ea9d0a18bd961f.jpg","listing_status":"sale","num_bedrooms":"2","location_is_approximate":0,"image_50_38_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/50/38/59092613300e2338d951df4117ea9d0a18bd961f.jpg","latitude":51.484432,"furnished_state":null,"agent_address":"246 Old Brompton Road, London","category":"Residential","property_type":"","letting_fees":"Transparency for tenants<br><br>Once you've found the perfect property and your offer has been accepted, we'll start preparing the tenancy agreement and organising the logistics for your 'move-in' day.

In the local area there is an abundance of restaurants and bars alongside retails outlets for your day to day convenience. There are three supermarkets within one mile, Tesco, Sainsburys and a Morison. Epping Forest and Highams Park are also within walking distance so bike rides, jogging and seasonal walks can be taken amidst all the different colours that mother nature has to offer. Schools in this area are highly regarded to and the road links offer excellent access to local towns, Westfield in Stratford and also Stansted Airport for international travel. This home presents a family with lots of versatility. The large kitchen/diner to the rear certainly seems as the heart of the home where many a family meal can be cooked and enjoyed, whilst the lounge which stretches from front to back provides all the space you could need for family gatherings or special occasions. The extra room to the ground floor is adjacent to the shower room, so this would really suit an elderly relative or would make a perfect office if you work from home. There are three bedrooms and a family bathroom to the first floor. Throughout this home it feels modern, spacious and bright. Beyond that as soon as you walk through the door there is a fantastic feeling of home. With off road parking to the front means it's easy to get in with your weekly shopping, and there is a pretty and private rear garden with a covered patio providing a perfect space for summer parties and barbecues.What the Owner says:For the past seven years we have really enjoyed this location. There is so much to do in the local area and some beautiful places to explore. There is a dental surgery close by and the doctors surgery is just 0.3 miles away.Since we have been here we have added a new roof, redecorated throughout, replaced the boiler and radiators and also refurbished the bathroom and shower room. The ground floor bedroom and shower room are perfect when we have people to visit and stay, but this also gives options for other uses. We have now decided to move to a different location but this has been a friendly neighbourhood and a happy seven years for us.Room sizes:Ground floorEntrance HallLounge 18'7 x 12'4 (5.67m x 3.76m)Kitchen/Diner 21'8 x 17'9 (6.61m x 5.41m)Shower RoomBedroom 3 13'3 x 8'10 (4.04m x 2.69m)First floorLandingBedroom 1 12'4 x 12'1 (3.76m x 3.69m)Bedroom 2 11'10 x 8'8 (3.61m x 2.64m)Bedroom 4 9'10 x 9'5 (3.00m x 2.87m)BathroomOutsideOff Road Parking To frontRear GardenThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.
