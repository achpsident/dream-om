The property offers the new buyer a turn key solution with stylish and contemporary design touches and a huge amount of natural light throughout which not only makes the property shine but adds to the welcoming and homely feel too. The existing owners have carried out a comprehensive refurbishment of the property which now enjoys a luxurious style, with flexible accommodation throughout, balanced by ample entertaining space.  The well designed accommodation provides the perfect layout for living with defined reception areas that seamlessly flow in to each other in a practical layout that is perfect for entertaining, social occasions and most importantly, day to day life. We are advising immediate inspection to fully appreciate the flexible accommodation as there is no chain and the sale is able to move at speed if desired.</p><p class=\"top\">The property benefits from a spacious reception hall which provides a great first impression, a large living room to the rear with doors to a secluded patio area and 55ft South/East facing rear garden, dining/family room, study, excellently proportioned kitchen with granite worktops and fitted appliances and a downstairs cloakroom that complete the ground floor. The well proportioned accommodation continues on the first floor with a master bedroom which benefits from an ensuite shower room, three further well proportioned double bedrooms and a contemporary family bathroom. There is also access to a useful loft space that offers extra storage and a large frontage that provides ample off street parking.</p><p class=\"top\">The village of Lower Kingswood is located approximately two miles inside the M25 and offers a choice of local shops, a highly regarded junior school, country pubs and open countryside where many fine footpaths, bridle paths and cycling can be enjoyed. Comprehensive shopping facilities can be found at the vibrant centres of Banstead and Epsom to the north and Reigate to the south. Rail services from Reigate, Tadworth and Kingswood provide services to London Bridge and Victoria, whilst the London to Brighton mainline can be accessed at Merstham. Often overlooked are the great bus links from Lower Kingwood with a regular service to Gatwick North and South Terminals as well as to London Victoria, both operated by National Express.</p><p class=\"top\">You may download, store and use the material for your own personal use and research.
