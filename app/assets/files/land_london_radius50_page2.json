In order to secure a Property we require to take upfront admin fees of £72 inclusive of VAT per tenant for referencing which includes a credit check, plus £180 inclusive of VAT for the administration. These fees are non refundable should you not proceed with the tenancy or if your references are not satisfactory. P.A Jones reserves the right to take a higher holding fee for larger Properties or for holding Properties for more than 1 month – to be agreed at offer stage. The Agency reserves the right to request a higher holding fee of up to one months rent if the property is held unavailable for over a month to be agreed at the point of reservation. Rent excludes the Tenancy Deposit and any other fees or charges which maybe payable.<br><br>2. Due to compliance with current money laundering regulations two forms of I.D. Must be shown prior to a full credit check &amp; referencing being completed, which requires details of your current address, employment details (or your accountants contact details if you are self-employed), your current Landlord or Letting Agent details (if relevant), bank details &amp; information regarding any county court judgements, rent arrears or adverse credit history. A character reference may also be required. The I.D must be one of the following: Current signed passport, identity card, current photo driving licence or armed forces id card/Police warrant card and one of the following: A recent utility bill or bank statement (not a mobile phone bill), council tax demand/statement, house or motor insurance certificate or paper part of current driving licence (dated within the last 3 months).<br><br>3. Once satisfactory references have been obtained you will be required to pay a security deposit (of 1 &amp; ½ months rent) plus the first months rent in advance (the holding fee of £200 per tenant will be deducted from this balance). This payment must be made in cleared funds i.E. Bank Draft, Building Society Cheque, Cash (if under £1000.00) or by debit or credit card. Personal cheques will not be accepted as payment.<br><br>4. All tenants wishing to occupy the property must come to the office to sign the tenancy<br>agreement on or before the tenancy start date. If a guarantor is required, the guarantor must also come to the office to sign a legal undertaking before the tenancy agreement is signed.<br><br>5. On or before the day you move in, it is the tenants responsibility to contact all the relevant utilities e.G. B.T., gas &amp; electricity suppliers, water boards and the local Council Tax department to provide relevant readings &amp; to transfer the accounts into your name/s.<br><br>6. Upon renewal or extension of this tenancy an administration fee of £50 +vat (£60.00) is payable for the preparation of any documents. Should you require a reference from the agent the cost is £20 +vat (£24.00) per tenant. If an addendum to contract is required during the tenancy an administration fee of £50 +vat (£60.00) will apply. Should you require the agent to visit the property for access due to loss of keys a charge of £20 +vat (£24.00) will be made. Any tenancy documents that you require for us to re-print and send to you (i.E. Tenancy agreements, inventories) will be charged for at £15 +vat (£18.00). If rental payments (made to us by card) are taken late on a regular basis an additional fee of £5.00 will be added to the payment. Charges also apply for the check-out procedure at the end of the tenancy (relative to the property size and contents). Unpaid charges or fees will be deducted from the security deposit at the end of the Tenancy.<br><br>7. Early release from the tenancy agreement will incur additional charges.","longitude":-0.097739,"thumbnail_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/80/60/09cf6a5b611d020eb71e43fad600af1562d9f40a.jpg","description":"A great opportunity to purchase the freehold which includes two existing flats and has Planning Permission to build two further flats.

The local towns of Sudbury, Ipswich and Colchester can all be accessed from the village in less than 40 minutes, all of which provide access to London by train.DescriptionThe site is an irregularly shaped parcel of land to the rear of the Houses at the end of Fitzgerald Meadow. It is bordered by houses to the south and south-west, and by mature trees to the north and north-east. Currently, the site comprises managed grassland but is not in cultivation or agricultural use.Site extends to approximately 1.36 acres (0.55ha).The site has appropriate rights over the land adjoining the site which provides access from the adopted highway. Details can be found within the Drop Box.PlanningThe site falls within Babergh District Council and it is believed that the site is outside of Boxford’s Settlement boundary, but borders it the south and west and is found within Boxford’s conservation area.The site is not in a flood zone, although the access to the site, Fen Drive, is in flood zone 3. Babergh have recently issued their updated Annual Monitoring Report for 2017-18, which states that after several years of under-delivery of housing the District is now able to demonstrate the required five year supply of housing land. Although the site is outside of Boxford’s settlement boundary and unallocated for housing development (and thus designated “countryside” for planning purposes), the site is well related to the village and could be considered a sustainable location.John Mason, a planner within Carter Jonas has carried out an initial planning appraisal, a copy of which is included within the Drop Box.Commercial terms• The owners are offering a conditional contract, initially for a period of 12 months with the right to extend for a further 12 months if a planning application or appeal decision remains outstanding.• The purchaser will be responsible for all costs involved in securing planning consent.• The planning application to be submitted in the joint names of the owner and the purchaser, to ensure the owner has step in rights if the purchasers withdraw.• All the surveys and reports commissioned by the purchasers to be in the joint names of the owners and the purchasers to ensure that they are available to the owners at no additional cost if the purchaser withdraws.• The developers to pay a contribution of £5000+VAT towards the owners agent fees, to be paid on conditional exchange of contracts.Additional informationA Drop Box for additional information has been created and access details are available from the agent.This information includes:• A planning appraisal prepared by Carter Jonas for the subject site.• Title Register• Title Plan• Bidding ProformaFurther informationShould you require any further information please contact either:Nick Muncey on alternatively, you can email; .OrCharles Harris on alternatively you can email; .","post_town":"Sudbury","details_url":"https://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/50431602?utm_source=v1:_qPMCSTPGhnVqh6uZKo4vy_qJBQ40eGZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"Residential development opportunity.

Full details, plans and correspondence relating to the planning application can be found on West Berkshire Council's planning portal under Planning permission no 18/02378/fuld.Prospective purchasers are advised to carry out their own due diligence relating to all aspects of the planning permission or possible future planning permissions.Health and Saftey Notice: Given the potential hazards of a derelict cottage we ask you to be vigilant as possible when making your inspection for your own personal safety. Access is not permitted inside the cottages and we would ask that prospective purchasers pay particular attention to any holes in the garden. Viewings are strictly by appointment only.48-49 Paices Hill lies on the edge of the popular village of Aldermaston; a thriving village with a strong community and an excellent range of local facilities including a village store, a well regarded primary school, The Hinds Head pub, hotel and restaurant and a hairdresser. There is also a train station serving London, Paddington within the hour. The nearby villages of Theale and Mortimer have a more comprehensive range of day to day facilities. The larger centres of Reading, Newbury and Basingstoke provide a full range of amenities. The M4 (J12) is six miles away and provides access to the West Country, London and its airports. The range of schooling available in the area, both state and private, is second to none, with The Cedars School in the village rated Ofsted Oustanding. Of particular note in the area are Elstree Preparatory School, Bradfield College, Pangbourne College, Downe House and St Andrews Preparatory School.

The design proposes each unit to be partly single-storey and partly two-storey with stained timber cladding under flat roofs.At the front, a centrally positioned glazed door would lead into a covered timber pergola-style reception area also with a rear glazed door to a private garden area at the back of each house. On the western side, an entrance area would open into a single-storey element, with green sedum roof, providing an office / studio, utility room and a cloak room. The reception hallway would extend right into the main ground-floor living accommodation with an open-plan living room, dining and kitchen area. At the eastern end, a staircase would ascend to the upper level containing the three bedrooms, one with en-suite shower room, and a family bathroom. The master bedroom at the front would have sliding glazed doors opening onto an enclosed south-facing balcony, that would overhang or cantilever, and provide shading to the ground-floor area below. At the rear would be a raised deck on adjustable pads and at the eastern side of each garden area, a single storey building would provide for bicycle and other storage.Each site is offered completely cleared with drainage installed in preparation for immediate construction.The site is situated within rare proximity of Camber Sands, a stunning five-mile stretch of unspoilt sandy beach located in East Sussex, close to the border with Kent.
