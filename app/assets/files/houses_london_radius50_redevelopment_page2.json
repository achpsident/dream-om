Further to the rear is a wonderful addition of a very useful conservatory, which is currently used as a dining area.Outside in the garden there are two self-contained units which are really useful for visiting guests or family, or just as additional storage, as needed, but these outbuildings are really useful.Upstairs this house has three double bedrooms and there is even more potential to extend into the loft, if another bedroom is needed (subject to planning permission).What the Owner says:Having lived here for many years, the time to upgrade is needed now as well as a change of area. Our house has been like our project for a long time, and we really feel that we have maximised the space on offer. The new owners will have no work to do and could move straight in.Having lots of parking, especially in this area, is really important and you can fit at least three cars on our drive as we have the electric shutter and side access available which is really good.The shops and train stations are also a short walk away and are really handy for those last minutes forgotten items.Room sizes:HallwayLounge 18'5 x 11'3 (5.62m x 3.43m)Living Room 17'0 x 8'8 (5.19m x 2.64m)Kitchen 16'6 x 8'1 (5.03m x 2.47m)Conservatory 9'6 x 7'3 (2.90m x 2.21m)LandingBedroom 1 12'2 x 11'1 (3.71m x 3.38m)Bedroom 2 9'3 x 8'5 (2.82m x 2.57m)Bedroom 3 8'5 x 8'5 (2.57m x 2.57m)BathroomOff Street ParkingRear GardenOutbuilding 1 15'4 x 12'5 (4.68m x 3.79m)Outbuilding 2 10'2 x 6'3 (3.10m x 1.91m)The information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.
